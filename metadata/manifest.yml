# The Erlang cartridge is acting as a service. This cartridge does not expose itself as a
# web-service by itself; in that sense it is slightly different than most other catridges.
# OpenShift currently requires a web cartridge type. SUCKS.

#     The other gears need to know the Host, so they can find the EPMD on the new gear,
#     ask which nodes are running there and then form a network.

# CLUSTER_PROXY_PORT: Erlang distribution needs a public listening port, because Erlang Nodes
#     need to connect directly with eachother (they normally form a fully connected network).
#     The value of the private port is not important.
# Mappins is needed to prevent errors in auto-scaled instances ()
